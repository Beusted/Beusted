Hey, I'm Brian!

I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science at California State University, Fullerton, where I’m developing a strong foundation in software engineering, AI/ML, and innovative problem-solving. I’m passionate about using technology to drive innovation and tackle complex challenges, and I'm always eager to learn new skills to stay ahead in our ever-evolving digital world.

Every day I strive to grow, learning from my experiences and pushing myself to become a better version of who I was yesterday. I enjoy opportunities that allow me to work collaboratively, contribute to exciting projects, and make a meaningful impact. I’m also known for my loyalty and commitment, always standing by my team and my goals through every challenge.

When I'm not immersed in technology, you'll likely find me dancing, listening to music, attending concerts and festivals, exploring new restaurants, and nature destinations.

Feel free to check out my [portfolio website](https://portfoliowebsite-eight-taupe.vercel.app/) which include ways to contact me, as well as my other projects/experience!

I’d be happy to hear from you :)
